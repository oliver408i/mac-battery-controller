# MacOS Battery Charging Controller
This is a GUI for [battery](https://github.com/actuallymentor/battery) (a CLI-based MacOS charging controller) by actuallymentor   
The above program does contain a GUI app for controlling the battery (a wrapper for the CLI basically) but it is very limited in its features, only being able to enable and disable the 80% battery charge limit, which is a shame because the CLI version has so much more to offer.   

## GUI Features
- Displays the battery charging state
- Output log directly from the CLI
- Enter any targeted percentage
- Charge and discharge to any percentage
- Maintain the battery at any percentage
- Enable and disable battery charging
